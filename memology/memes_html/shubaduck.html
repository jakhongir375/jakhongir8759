            <p>Shuba Duck / Dancing Duck Oozora Subaru, also known as Subaru Duck, refers to an animation of a duck in a backward baseball cap dancing alongside virtual Hololive influencer Oozora Subaru. The duck is a representation of Subaru, who is often likened to a duck for her raspy ASMR voice, among other reasons. The duck took on the nickname "Shuba Duck" or "Shubaduck" based on Subaru's habit of regularly saying "shuba" when excited and became the subject of a number of memes, mostly image macros, on Reddit in May 2021.</p>

            <p>On September 16th, 2018, Holoive debuted virtual influencer Oozora Subaru, described as a tomboyish extrovert on her Fandom page. When Subaru is excited or content she often repeats the word "shuba." She always wears a backward baseball cap and is often compared to a duck by both viewers and herself on-stream, with "duck" becoming one of her nicknames. This is due largely to both her tomboyish demeanor and her rough ASMR voice, often compared to a duck.</p>
            
            <p>Memes about Subaru often depict her as a duck or use ducks in some way, such as a series of videos by YouTuber Pok pok ch. started on March 2nd, 2021, putting audio of Subaru over footage of ducks</p>
        
            <p>On March 13th, 2021, Twitter user @KS_wktk uploaded an original animation of Oozora Subaru dancing next to a duck wearing the same backward baseball cap, garnering over 100,000 likes and 24,000 retweets in two months</p>
