            <p class="meaning__text"> A meme is an idea, symbol, or image that spreads quickly from person to person and on the Internet. Memes are typically informal, humorous or satirical, and associated with specific events or people.
            </p>
            <p class="meaning__text">Users create memes themselves based on a certain template: they adapt the finished image to their situation.
            </p>
            <p class="meaning__text">The term "meme" and its understanding were coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in 1976 in his book The Selfish Gene. Dawkins proposed the idea that all culturally significant information is composed of basic units - memes, just as biological information is composed of genes; and just like genes, memes are subject to natural selection, mutation and artificial selection. </p>
            <p class="meaning__text">Memes are of the following types:</p>
            <ul class="meaning__text">
                <li>visual (information received through visual receptors);</li>
                <li>auditory (information received through auditory receptors);</li>
                <li>text (information received through text);</li>
                <li>mixed (anything that includes more than two types).</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="meaning__text">Memes have a short-term and long-term lifespan.</p>
            <ul class="meaning__text">
                <li>Long-term memes can be defined as those memes that are used by everyone and spread very actively.</li>
                <li>A short-term meme is one that quickly appeared and was quickly forgotten.</li>
